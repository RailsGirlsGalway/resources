Dear <>,

I'm co-organising Rails Girls Galway, a free 2-days workshop for women to learn programming a Web application. It's meant to demystify coding, let attendees have fun and be creative with it, plus demolishing stereotypes.

I think the members of your group may be interested in applying (places are limited). could you kindly, please, consider posting the event in your group? An announcement follows below. thanks  a million!

Rails Girls is back to Galway!

A *free* non-profit 2-days workshop willprovide a first approach to Web application

development.
It relies on the Ruby on Rails framework and on the Rails Girls worldwide community.

Places are limited so be sure to submit your application http://railsgirls.com/galway
(deadline: <>).


Cheers,
<> (on behalf of Rails Girls Galway)
