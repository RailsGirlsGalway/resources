Dear <> Team,

I hope this is the correct address to contact for my own inquiry. If
not, may you kindly advise me otherwise, please?

I am an organiser of the Galway, Ireland, chapter of the worldwide
RailsGirls movement. Currently, I am organizing a programming workshop
in Galway, on <month> <dates> [1] applying the successful RailsGirls format
to address the IT gender gap.

In the past years, several companies sponsored us [2] and we received an average of 100
applications, out of which we selected an average of 70 participants each time.

This year, we are searching for sponsors to cover our expenses, as
detailed at [3]. Among those expenses we will give priorities to food, printed
materials and t-shirts.

Would you be interested in sponsoring us?
Thanks a million!


Best regards,
<> on behalf of Rails Girls Galway
